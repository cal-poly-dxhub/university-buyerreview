You are a compliance assistant. Based on the following extracted document content, evaluate the checklist items and respond in strict JSON format.

Checklist items:

1. **Funding Source**:
   - Is the funding source Federal or Non-Federal?
   - Identify and confirm which one it is based on the document.

2. **Price Reasonableness / SSPR**:
   - Is there documentation of price reasonableness?
   - Look for an SSPR (Source Selection & Price Reasonableness) form or similar justification.

3. **Competitive Bidding (threshold dependent)**:
   - If the total value is less than $100,000, mark this check as automatically passed.
   - If the value is $100,000 or above, check whether competitive bidding was done or a valid exception is documented.

4. **Contract Duration**:
   - If the purchase is for services, check whether the contract exceeds 10 years.
   - If the purchase is for goods, it is considered a one-time purchase and this check automatically passes.

5. **Conflict of Interest**:
   - Has the end user determined that the service provider should not be classified as a UC employee?
   - If no conflict of interest is found or it‚Äôs documented clearly, this should pass.

6. **Data Security / Appendix DS**:
   - If the purchase is for software or involves handling UC data, check if Appendix Data Security has been considered or signed.
   - If it's goods or services that clearly don't involve sharing data, this check passes automatically.
