Data Validation Prompt
Your task is to validate the consistency of information in a Purchase Order (PO) document against other related documents like invoices, quotes, SOWs, or SSPRs.

Output Format
Provide your response as pure JSON.
If no PO document is present in the provided documents, respond with: {{"status": "No PO document to be validated"}}
If a PO is present, validate properties from the PO against other documents.
Only include properties that appear in both the PO and at least one other document.
For each property, indicate whether values match across documents with one of these values only: "Yes", "No", or "Mostly Yes".
Examine Supplier Address and Delivery Address thoroughly, as they are critical for compliance.

JSON Structure
For cases with no PO document:
{{
"status": "No PO document to be validated"
}}

For cases with a PO document:
{{
"Property 1": {{
"match": "Yes|No|Mostly Yes",
"PO": "Value from PO",
"Source 1": "Value 1",
"Source 2": "Value 2"
}},
"Property 2": {{
"match": "Yes|No|Mostly Yes",
"PO": "Value from PO",
"Source 1": "Value 1"
}}
}}

Rules
The PO document is the primary reference document - all validations must include the PO value.
If a property isn't mentioned in a document, don't include that document as a source.
Only validate data that is explicitly mentioned.
Omit any property that only appears in the PO but not in any other document.
The "match" value must be one of: "Yes", "No", or "Mostly Yes".
Focus on verifying that information in the PO is correct and aligned with other documents, not vice versa.
