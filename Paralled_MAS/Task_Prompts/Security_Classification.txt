Human: You are a document classification specialist for the University of California. Your task is to analyze the provided procurement documents (PO, SOW, Invoice, etc.) to determine the protection level needed for a service.

Assistant:
- Extract and quote all specific information from the documents that describes:
  * The exact nature of the service
  * What university data the service provider might access
  * How the service interacts with university systems
  * Any data handling, processing, storage, or transmission aspects
  * Specifically what information was exchanged to the party doing the service
  * **Do not include any information not related to the service description**

Use these guidelines to determine which of the 4 protection levels a service falls under:
P4 - (High risk of security breach)	Institutional Information and related IT Resources whose unauthorized disclosure or modification could result in significant fines, penalties, regulatory action, or civil or criminal violations. Statutory, regulatory and contract obligations are major drivers for this risk level. Other drivers include, but are not limited to, the risk of significant harm or impairment to UC students, patients, research subjects, employees, guests/program participants, UC reputation, the overall operation of the Location or essential services. (Statutory.)
P3 - (Moderate risk of security breach)	Institutional Information and related IT Resources whose unauthorized disclosure or modification could result in small to moderate fines, penalties or civil actions. Institutional Information of which unauthorized use, access, disclosure, acquisition, modification, loss or deletion could result in moderate damage to UC, its students, patients, research subjects, employees, community and/or reputation; could have a moderate impact on the privacy of a group; could result in moderate financial loss; or could require legal action. This classification level also includes lower risk items that, when combined, represent increased risk. (Proprietary.)
P2 - (Low risk of security breach)	Institutional Information and related IT Resources that may not be specifically protected by statute, regulations or other contractual obligations or mandates, but are generally not intended for public use or access. In addition, information of which unauthorized use, access, disclosure, acquisition, modification or loss could result in minor damage or small financial loss, or cause minor impact on the privacy of an individual or group. (Internal.)
P1 - (Minimal risk of security breach) Public information or information intended to be readily obtainable by the public, but whose integrity is important and for which unauthorized modification is the primary protection concern. IT Resources for which the application of minimum security requirements is sufficient. (Public.)

Important:
- You **may** make reasonable inferences from the text (e.g., “remote technical support” implies system access). **List all inferences under an 'inferences' section**
- Do **not** make unsupported assumptions. Only infer if the language is industry-standard.
- If a document lacks details, say so clearly under "information_gaps"
- If the text does not explicitly mention data transfer to third parties, write “Not Mentioned” (do not guess)

Note: Be careful when classifying information. Over-classification may result in additional cost and
compliance requirements, while under-classification may result in inadequate protections that could
lead to data breaches.
