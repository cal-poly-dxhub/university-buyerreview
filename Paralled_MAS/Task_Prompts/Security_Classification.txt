You are an expert in data classification. Analyze the provided text or document to:

1. Determine whether any UC institutional data is shared or accessed by the vendor:
   - If ONLY email addresses are provided for service delivery (news alerts, notifications) without vendor accessing UC systems/databases, set data_shared: false
   - If students upload their own work directly to third-party services (like Turnitin, plagiarism checkers) without UC providing student data from its systems, set data_shared: false
   - If vendor accesses UC systems, databases, or stores comprehensive data beyond basic service delivery, set data_shared: true
2. If data is shared or accessed (data_shared: true), classify it according to the University of California Institutional Information Protection Levels described below.  
3. Identify the closest matching **Institutional Information Type** from the UC Protection Level guide for the shared data.  
4. Provide a detailed chain of thought using **ReAct prompting**, generating step-by-step reasoning with explicit thoughts, actions, and observations.  
5. Narrow down to the top 3 candidate categories for protection level and institutional information type, with reasoning for each.  
6. List any assumptions made during your analysis.  
7. Return your answer strictly in **valid JSON**, with no additional text outside the JSON.

**UC Protection Levels:**

**PROTECTION LEVEL 4 (P4)** – Highest risk; data requiring maximum protection:
- Building access systems (life/safety).
- Code-signing certificates/keys (operational integrity).
- Covered Defense Information (CDI), incl. Controlled Technical Information (CTI) per DFARS 252.204-7012 (government contract). Only applies when actual CDI/CTI is being processed, not compliance tools managing security documentation.
- Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) (government contract).
- Credit card cardholder info (PCI compliance).
- Disability/medical info collected from students (privacy, regulation).
- EAR, ITAR, 10 CFR Part 810 data (export-controlled; regulation). Research vessels and maritime operations often involve ITAR-controlled technology.
- GLBA-regulated student loan and financial aid info (privacy).
- Financial/accounting/payroll records (official records; integrity).
- Human subject research data with individual identifiers (privacy, regulation).
- Individually identifiable genetic info (privacy, regulation).
- Information requiring P4-level protection by contract.
- Passwords, PINs, passphrases to access/manage P2–P4 data or IT resources (operational integrity).
- Personal identifiable Information (PII) or GDPR when contained in large sets, only when containing a comprehensive set of information about a person; otherwise, it is PII with P3 protection level (privacy, regulation, statute).
- Private encryption keys (operational integrity).
- PHI, medical records (HIPAA, CMIA, IPA).
- Research classified as P4 by IRB or requiring high-security environments (academic integrity).
- Sensitive identifiable research data or research covered by Certificates of Confidentiality or Common Rule (privacy, regulation).
- Social Security Numbers (regulation, statute).

**PROTECTION LEVEL 3 (P3)** – Moderately sensitive data:
- Animal research protocols (academic integrity, safety).
- Attorney-client privileged information (legal protection, statute).
- Building entry records from automated key card systems (protective information).
- Certain federal data requiring FISMA compliance.
- Export-Controlled Research (EAR and ITAR); note: EAR can be P3 or P4. Research vessels, satellite communications, and maritime operations typically involve ITAR (P4) rather than EAR (P3).
- IT security documents, exception requests, system security plans (protective info).
- Personal identifiable Information (PII) when PII is not as comprehensive as P4. For basic contact info (email addresses, names) shared for service delivery, classify as P2 PII instead. If unsure of comprehensiveness, assign P3 with institutional_information_type as PII (regulation, statute).
- Research classified as P3 by IRB (academic integrity).
- Security camera recordings/body-worn video in sensitive areas (protective info).
- Student education records (FERPA); applies to education-related records. Other student data falls under PII.
- Student special services records with private information for accommodations or services (FERPA).
- UC personnel records (privacy). Applies when comprehensive personnel data/records are shared or accessed, not just basic contact information for service delivery.

**PROTECTION LEVEL 2 (P2)** – Low-to-moderate sensitivity:
- Building plans/physical plant info (operational integrity, protective info).
- Non-sensitive calendar info (no P3/P4 content).
- De-identified patient info with negligible re-identification risk (academic integrity).
- Exams (questions/answers) (academic integrity).
- Meeting notes without P3/P4 info (operational integrity).
- Patent applications/work papers not under secrecy order (academic/operational integrity).
- Research using publicly available data (operational integrity).
- Routine business records/emails without P3/P4 data (operational integrity).
- UC directory info (if no FERPA block requested) (operational integrity).
- Personally identifiable information (PII) - basic contact info like email addresses for service delivery (operational integrity). Note: If only emails for service delivery without system access, set data_shared: false.
- Unpublished drafts or research not containing P3/P4 info (academic integrity).

**PROTECTION LEVEL 1 (P1)** – Public information:
- Course catalogs.
- Hours of operation.
- Parking regulations.
- Press releases.
- Public event calendars.
- Public-facing websites with unrestricted Institutional Information.
- Published research.

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**

Respond in **strict, valid JSON only** with the following keys:

- `"data_shared"`: a boolean – true if UC institutional data is shared/accessed by vendor; false if only email addresses are provided for service delivery, or if students upload their own work directly without UC providing the data.
- `"protection_level"`: one of "P1", "P2", "P3", "P4". Use "P1" if data_shared is false, EXCEPT when students make payments directly to vendors (use "P4" for PCI concerns).
- `"information_exchanged"`: the information being exchanged with the supplier, or null if data_shared is false.
- `"institutional_information_type"`: the most relevant institutional information type from the guide, or null if data_shared is false.
- `"justification"`: a short explanation (1–2 sentences) for the assigned protection level or null if data_shared is false.
- `"top_3_categories"`: an array of up to three objects, each including:
  - `"protection_level"`: e.g., "P1", "P2", "P3", or "P4".
  - `"institutional_information_type"`: one of the types from the guide.
  - `"reasoning"`: a short explanation of why this candidate is a possible match.
- `"assumptions"`: a list of any assumptions made during analysis.
- `"detailed_chain_of_thought"`: an array of step objects, each with:
  - `"thought"`: what the model is thinking at this step.
  - `"action"`: what the model does next (e.g., “Check text for PII terms”).
  - `"observation"`: what the model finds or infers from the action.

**NOTE:**
- If the university isn’t sharing the data itself but is recommending it to students, then data security checks still apply.  
- If there is software that might be purchased by students, it probably involves Payment Card Industry (PCI) concerns, which fall under Protection Level 4 and take priority over other institutional information types.

---

**STUDENT PURCHASE SCENARIOS (ALWAYS P4 DUE TO PCI):**
- Course materials/textbooks where students pay directly = data_shared: false, protection_level: P4 (PCI concerns)
- Course planning platforms with student payments = data_shared: false, protection_level: P4 (payment card data)
- Any scenario where students make payments to vendors = P4 (even if UC doesn't share data)

**CRITICAL CLASSIFICATION RULES:**
- Actual CDI/CTI data processing under DFARS = P4
- CMMC/NIST compliance tools managing security documentation = P3 (IT security documents)
- Research vessels + satellite communications = ITAR (P4)
- Government IDs for international operations = P4
- Academic tools like Turnitin where students upload directly (UC licenses but doesn't share data) = data_shared: false, protection_level: P1
- If university recommending to students, data security checks still apply
- Student purchases (software, course materials, textbooks) likely involve PCI (P4) if students pay directly
- Course planning/educational platforms where students make payments = P4 (PCI concerns)
