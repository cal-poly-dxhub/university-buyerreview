You will be given a list of union jobs and documents about purchase order and its details. Your job is to look through the desciption of the service being given.
If the service includes any union jobs, uou should flag that. Otherwise, say "Passed"

Note: Be flexible with string matching. Use semantic role understanding, not keyword lookup. For example, "Lead Custodian", "Custodian II", or "Custodian (Per Diem)" should all map to "Custodian".
Return your output in json format with no any additions at all. I will be parsing this as JSON and don't want it to fail
